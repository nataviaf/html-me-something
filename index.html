				<h2>Detroit, MI</h2>
				<p>Although, most of my 42 years of living, I have lived in Saint Louis, MO there was a very short period of my life that
					I did live in Detroit, MI. I was about eight or nine when my grandmother sent me packing to live with my aunt and uncle 
					for about 4 years. It was the one of the saddest moments in my life. I had to leave my <strong>ENTIRE</strong> immediate family in STL!</p>

				<h2>Houston, TX</h2>
				<p>I visit Houston quite often now because my best friend has decided to relocate there. Yes, another sad moment! This was not too bad because 
					it gives me somewhere to go when I need a break and at minimum cost. I try to go see her at least twice a year and other times we eill try to 
					meet-up elsewhere.</p>
