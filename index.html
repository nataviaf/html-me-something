							<h2>Detroit, MI</h2>
							<p class="p_text">Although, most of my 42 years of living, I have lived in Saint Louis, MO there was a very short period of my life that
								I did live in Detroit, MI. I was about eight or nine when my grandmother sent me packing to live with my aunt and uncle 
								for about 4 years. It was the one of the saddest moments in my life. I had to leave my <strong>ENTIRE</strong> immediate family in STL!</p>

							<h2>Houston, TX</h2>
							<p class="p_text">I visit Houston quite often now because my best friend has decided to relocate there. Yes, another sad moment! This was not too bad because 
								it gives me somewhere to go when I need a break and at minimum cost. I try to go see her at least twice a year and other times we eill try to 
								meet-up elsewhere.</p>

							<h2>Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands</h2>
							<p class="p_text">This was one of the best trips in my life! I stayed for an entire week. The weather was perfect and the water was the most beautiful water I have
								ever seen. I was so blue and clear. While I was there I took a boat ride over to both St. Croix and St. John. </p>
